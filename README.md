# BinaryTree-SpellErrros

Compile:
javac BTree.java
javac Tbtree.java 
javac Tian.java

Test if binary tree working:
java Tbtree -> output shoud be equal to : TestBinaryTree

Test main Program: PS: dictionary.txt must be on the same folder
java Tian < input
output shoud be equal to: output

Considerations:
This is was a mandatory work of a curse in UiO in september'17 -> I'm not enroll in the class, was borred asked for the pdf and the dictionary.pdf.
Took me around 3 hours between writing the code and testing 
uploading this now because needed to test how upload from git

Peace out bro
